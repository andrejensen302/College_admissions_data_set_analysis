The following is some of my basic observations and analysis that I found within the College Admissions dataset.

- I first wanted to analyze the data on a more granular level based on similar attributes (in this case it would be colleges that have a high number of low-income and first generation college college attendees. I broke down the data into three clusters different clusters using Kmeans Clustering as shown in the table below.

- The chart below shows the same clusters as the table above but in a ggplot.

- The chart and table below breaks it down into five different clusters.
